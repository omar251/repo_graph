## Migration Guide

### From v1.x to v2.x

#### Command Line Changes
```bash
# Old (v1.x)
node analyze_dependencies.js /path/to/repo

# New (v2.x) - same functionality
node analyze_dependencies.js /path/to/repo

# New options available
node analyze_dependencies.js --verbose --include-external /path/to/repo
```

#### Output Format Changes
- Default output is now pure JSON instead of JavaScript variable
- Use `--format js` for the old JavaScript format
- Enhanced metadata included in output

#### Visualization Changes
- Open `dependency_graph.html` as before
- New features available through the enhanced UI
- Better responsive design for mobile devices

### Upgrading

1. **Backup your data**: Save any existing network-data.json files
2. **Update files**: Replace analyze_dependencies.js and dependency_graph.html
3. **Test**: Run analysis on a small project first
4. **Configure**: Adjust any automation scripts for new CLI options
